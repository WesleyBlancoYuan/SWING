# SWING

This branch is created for two purposes:

 - 1. For Github repository limitation: Github requires at least one branch present in a repository, the "default" one. But I want to organize the repo in a way that all Swing-related projects are committed into the same repo as different remote branches. By making a empty "master" remote branch, now it's possible for me to delete other remote branches.
 - 2. For reminding me about not to commit into here, it's proteced, so that when I want to commit here, it requires merge first, so I can be aware to commit to another branch like "master_xxx".
